        </h1>

        <p class="lead text-center text-md-start mb-4">
            Everything you need to find the right car — simple, honest, and stress-free.

            <p>
                West Chester, where highways hum and dreams take flight,
                There stands a place of promise—GTX Auto Group, glowing bright.
                Beneath wide Ohio skies and sunlit dealership lots,
                They offer not just steel and wheels, but trust in every thought.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, engines rest like sleeping lions, ready to awaken,
                Polished chrome and handpicked care, each vehicle unshaken.
                Trucks with shoulders broad as barns, SUVs like rolling hills,
                Cars that whisper stories still untold, waiting to fulfill.
            </p>
            <p>
                But more than horsepower or the gleam of paint in day’s caress,
                It’s honesty that turns the key—the quiet strength of success.
                No haggling shadows, no fine-print snares, no masks behind a smile,
                Just friendly hands and open doors that stretch for country miles.
            </p>
            <p>
                You’ll find the team not selling dreams, but guiding you with grace,
                They listen first, then help you match the road you’re meant to face.
                Whether you're chasing sunsets or the morning’s early light,
                There’s a vehicle for every journey—priced to feel just right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each customer, a story, each handshake a vow,
                That quality and care are not just words, but lived here, now.
                A single visit feels like home, familiar and sincere,
                Where choices bloom without regret and every path feels clear.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stress dissolves like summer rain, replaced by calm and ease,
                You leave not just with keys in hand, but a heart at peace.
                Because GTX doesn’t simply sell—they serve with all their might,
                With integrity their cornerstone, and satisfaction their right.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
                So come where trust is built to last, where value holds its ground,
                Where cars and kindness intertwine, and joy is always found.
                For journeys born in West Chester’s light, and built on proven trust,
                GTX Auto Group is the name that rises up from dust.
