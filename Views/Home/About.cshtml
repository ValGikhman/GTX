                    <p>
                        It seems though that some of the biggest problems with the internet advertising trends
                        are the lack of

                    <p>
                        Where do you register your complaints? How can you protest in any form against companies
                        whose

                        So in final analysis: it’s true, I hate peeping Toms, but if I had to choose, I’d take

                <p>
                    Now, I’m not like Robin, that weirdo from my cultural anthropology class; I think that
                    advertising is something that has its place in our society; which for better or worse is
                    structured along a marketplace economy. But, simply because I feel advertising has a right
                    to exist, doesn’t mean that I like or agree with it, in its

                    Where do you register your complaints? How can you protest in any form against companies
                    whose advertising techniques you don’t agree with? You don’t. And on another point of
                    difference between traditional products and their advertising and those of the internet
                    nature, simply ignoring internet advertising is
